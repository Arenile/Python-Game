How to setup your development environment for the game:

1) You're going to want to go get python 3.8.2. Be sure to check the option to add arguments to your system path
if you haven't done that before unless you want to manually set that up.

2) Create a directory on your OS drive called "PythonPrograms" then in that folder make a folder called "Python-Game" 
Yes, I am aware that this means that when you setup the repository on your machine this will result in a folder called
Python-Game inside a folder called Python-Game but that's the way it is for now

3) Next you need to install pygame. https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted walks through the installation process
(it's just a command, so as long as python is set up properly it shouldn't be too hard)

4) Finally clone the repository to the directory you created earlier, this should result in the gameLoop.py file being located in
"C:\PythonPrograms\Python-Game\Python-Game\gameLoop.py" If this isn't what your directory looks like, then you may have problems
getting the code to compile and run

5) Be sure that your development environment is running python 3.8.2 and you should be good to go. I personally use VSCode.
